# You are developing the functionality that will calculate the number of steps it takes to travel a certain distance in steps

# This in the flow:
# 1. User enters the number of distance to travel in meters
# 2. User is asked if they want to walk, run, or sprint the distance
# 3. If the user walks, they travel 1 step at a time. If they run they travel 2 steps at a time, if they sprint they travel 3 steps at a time.
# 4. Display the number of steps the user takes to travel the distance and the time it takes.

# Notes:
# - It takes 3 steps to travel 1 meter.
# - It takes 15 minutes to travel one kilometer at walking pace
