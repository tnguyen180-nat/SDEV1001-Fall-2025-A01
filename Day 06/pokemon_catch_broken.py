# This program is meant to simulate the process of catching a Charizard in the wild.
# Charizard has a catch threshold of 95, meaning a player must score at least 95 when they throw a ball to catch it.
# There are four types of balls, and each add a bonus to the catch chance.
#   - Poke Ball, Bonus: 10
#   - Great Ball, Bonus: 30
#   - Ultra Ball, Bonus: 50
#   - Master Ball, Bonus: 100
# The player chooses a ball, and the bonus is added to the player's roll when they try to catch the Charizard
